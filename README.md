## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *“[Inefficiency and Inaccessibility in Traditional Lending Systems for the Masses]”*  
Access to credit in developing economies like India is heavily restricted due to complex verification procedures, high-interest rates, limited reach of financial institutions, and trust issues between lenders and borrowers. Millions of people remain underbanked or credit-invisible, especially in rural and semi-urban regions. The solution to this problem statement would help change this for the better

## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* MINCENT  

Our platform introduces a decentralized, AI-powered microloan system that allows anyone—from rural farmers to urban gig workers—to access affordable credit instantly. By integrating AI for document verification and creditworthiness assessment, users can sign up with land ownership or similar proofs and receive approvals in minutes instead of weeks. Once verified, borrowers gain access to tailored loan offers based on their CIBIL and reliability scores, with interest rates significantly lower than those offered by traditional financial institutions.

The platform uses Ethereum (ETH) for funding loans, enabling global lenders to participate transparently and securely. Borrowers receive INR payouts through UPI integration, ensuring seamless real-world utility. Lenders, on the other hand, are protected by an insurance pool that compensates them in case of borrower default. AI agents on both borrower and lender sides ensure intelligent loan matching, risk assessment, and transparency, turning the loan process into a personalized, data-driven experience.

This solution empowers underserved populations with quick, fair access to credit while providing a meaningful investment vehicle for crypto-holders and retail lenders. It bridges the gap between decentralized finance and real-world impact, making financial inclusion scalable and efficient. Through gamified reliability scores and AI-driven interest rate adjustments, users are incentivized to build financial discipline—making the entire ecosystem stronger, more secure, and future-ready.
